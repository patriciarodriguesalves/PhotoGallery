        <h2>Border Collie</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="description">
           Border Collies are famous herders, and according to the American Kennel Club,
           these canines are some of the most agile, balance, and durable dogs around.
           Obedience training should start early, and mental stimulation is necessary 
           to keep them happy.</p>

          <h2>Poodle</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            Poodles aren't just pretty pups — they're pretty good at sports,
            too. According to the American Kennel Club, these canines are great at agility,
            obedience, and tracking sports because of how easy they are to train. They exceed
            in in water retrieval, dock diving, and even hunting tests.</p>

          <h2>German Shepherd</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            It's almost hard to believe that this breed's original calling was to hoard sheep,
            not protect and serve in the police academy. According to the American Kennel Club,
            these canines are so fierce and intelligent that they help out the nation's finest 
            during the toughest of times. They enjoy reward-based training, living with families,
            and of course, being treated with respect.</p>

          <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            Golden Retrievers are hard workers, hands down. According to The Smart Canine, 
            they are the fourth smartest dog breed for their obedience and working intelligence. 
            According to the American Kennel Club, the breed is a top pick for seeing-eye roles,
            in search-and-rescue situations, and in field work. They’re easy to train, but require a  
            lot of love and bonding time. If you give these pups attention, 
            they’ll give you loyalty right back.</p>

          <h2>Doberman</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            Dobermans are fierce protecters that are easily trained from the day they are born.
            According to Dog Time, being a guard dog is a natural instinct to them, so they are extremely 
            protective of their owners. But if they're not raised properly, they'll become pushy and start
            running your household. These smart canines are quick to respond to action and command, but definitely 
            need loving at home.</p>

          <h2>Shetland Sheepdog</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            The Sheltie is one of the most successful obedience breeds, according to the American Kennel Club.
            Like the Border Collie, they're eager to please their owners and once taught the basics during 
            obedience training, they'll be set for life. They do love strangers, however, so just make sure 
            to keep them on a tight leash wherever you go.</p>

          <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            According to Dogcare, Labrador Retrievers are actually traditional "waterdogs," who originally 
            had jobs many years ago hunting ducks and accompanying fishermen. Their flat, otter-like tails
            and weather-resistant coats allow them to thrive in the water. But besides their physical traits,
            these pups are extremely smart and lovable — great for any kind of home.</p>

          <h2>Papillon</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="description">            
            According to Caratoots, Papillons have a strong connection to famous royals, 
            like Marie Antoinette. These small dogs love to compete — and win — at sports
            competitions, and participate in all kinds of tricks. For less ambitious owners,
            you'll be happy to know that Papillons enjoy all types of weather and simply
            playing with family.</p>
